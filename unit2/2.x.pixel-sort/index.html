    I chose to do this one because I really wanted to try this project on a space themed photo.
    I also chose it because purple is my favorite color! I think this one is probably my favorite.
    This one was angled and had a lower threshold

    I chose to do this one because I was hoping it would only alter the tree and create a cool pixel
    piece amid a regular background. I'm really happy that's actually what happened. I wanted this one
    to be less chaotic and more natural.
    This one had both a lower and upper threshold.

    I chose this one because I thought it would look cool to have the mountain stretch into the sky. I 
    tried that version and didn't really like it so I reversed the direction and it ended up creating a
    different color blue at the very top that I really like.
    This one was angled and sorted by saturation.

    I chose this one because I really like how my first space one turned out and wanted to do another.
    After seeing a plain pixel sorted version, I wanted to see how the sorting function would work.
    I played around with it and liked how sorting by hue gave it a scratchier look.
    This one was angled and sorted by hue.

    I chose this one because I wanted to try and make a pixel sorted image where it seemed like one part
    of the picture was stretching into the other. I tried it previously with a flower and the picture
    didn't really work. I really like how this turned out fter adjusting it to make the stretch across
    the screen look nicer.
    This one was angled and had an upper threshold.

    I chose this one because the space ones were my favorite. I also really liked this original photo
    because of the horse head in the nebula and was curious what pixel sorting would do. I am actually
    really happy that the horse head was almost highlighted by the lines.
    This one was angled, sorted, and had an upper threshold.

  <title>Safety?: Unhelpful Instructions for Emergency Situations, by Kenzie Swain</title>

    I wrote this text generator in Python on April 7, 2008, never distributed or
    exhibited it, and just found it recently among older files. On September 15,
    2019, I wrote this HTML/JavaScript implementation of the generator. In terms
    of the way text is generated, this version functions exactly as does the
    2008 Python program. The typography is different, as the Python program runs
    in a terminal window.

    My Reimplementation
    I chose to reimplement Safety by Nick Montfort. https://nickm.com/poems/safety.html
    I wanted to make this piece a lot more whimsical and funny. I replaced the words for the safety 
    instructions with nonsense that would make funny and nonsensical sentences/directions when randomly
    combined. I'm really happy with how this turned out and I like how whimsical it feels.

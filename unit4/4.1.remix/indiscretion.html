Mackenzie Swain. Reimplementation of Through the Park by Nick Montfort https://nickm.com/poems/through_the_park.html

I wanted to make a story that was like Through the Park where it could have a bad ending or a good ending.
I chose to write a story about a couple who hosted a party and there are two separate endings where the 
party went well and one where the wife murders the husband. I really like how this turned out and I enjoy
the different stories that come out of it given the randomness.
